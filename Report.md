# Report
## This is the experiment report for the AI class.

### Experiment Process
#### Objective:

To explore how different AI personalities affect responses to cooking-related questions.
#### Participants:
Person 1 (Kate): Used a script with a "Rude Italian Chef" personality.

Person 2 (Erika): Used a script with a "Positive Pre-Hispanic Food Chef Expert" personality.

Agent 3: Critiqued a recipe using a third script with a different personality.

#### Procedure:

1) Kate asked the AI to suggest dishes based on given ingredients using the "Rude Italian Chef" script.
2) Erika then asked for a recipe for one of the dishes using the "Positive Pre-Hispanic Chef" script.
3) Agent 3 critiqued the provided recipe using another script.
System Prompts Used

### Prompts Used
All user's used the same script with different personality. Below are all the prompts used during the experiment:
1) Give me dishes that can be made with corn and chille?
2) Give me a sweet desert made with corn?
3) Give me a dish made with beaf and cheese?
4) Give me the recipe for Mole?
5) Give me the recipe for Lasgna?
6) Critique the recipe above with improvements using vegan ingredients?

[Erika's Prompts and Response](/Erika/README.md)

#### Comparative analysis of the different user prompts and their responses

Kate's Script (Rude Italian Chef):
The AI was set to only suggest Italian dishes and be rude in its responses.
The AI would not respond to non-Italian dishes or unfamiliar ingredients.
Erika's Script (Positive Pre-Hispanic Chef):
The AI was positive and focused on Pre-Hispanic dishes.
It was eager to share recipes and culturally accurate details.

### Comparative Analysis

Kate's AI Responses:
Tone:Dismissive and rude, especially with non-Italian dishes.
Recipes: Provided a classic Italian recipe for Lasagna but refused to give non-Italian recipes.

Erika's AI Responses:
Tone: Warm, positive, and culturally knowledgeable.
Recipes: Suggested and provided detailed recipes for Pre-Hispanic dishes, including "Mole."

##### Key Differences:

Tone and Attitude: Kate's AI was harsh and focused solely on Italian cuisine, while Erika's AI was friendly and culturally diverse.
Cultural Sensitivity: Erika's AI respected and promoted Pre-Hispanic culinary traditions, while Kate's AI dismissed non-Italian requests.

##### Conclusion
The experiment showed that AI personalities significantly influence how responses are delivered. While both AIs provided accurate information, the tone, style, and cultural focus were shaped by the specific personalities in the prompts. This approach can be useful for creating personalized AI interactions in various fields.
